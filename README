# Fido Pico

This project works in conjuntion with my Fido robot.
Because the Nvidia Jetson does not have a built-in ADC, I need something to report
sensor values of the Sharp IR range sensors I'm using. This reads from the ADC
and publishes it over serial.

# Building
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

# Installing on Raspberry Pi Pico
While pressing the BOOTSEL button on the Pico, connect it to your computer with a Micro USB cable.
Take the generated `build/fido_pico.uf2` and copy it to the Pico drive that shows up.
Restart the Pico.
